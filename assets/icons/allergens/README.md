# Design Notes:
The Erudus Food Allergy Icons are designed to help users quickly and easily identify in a graphical format whether a food product contains or may contain any of the EU’s 14 Major Food Allergens, as outlined in the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation No. 1169/2011 and EU Food Information Regulation 1169/2001 (FIR).

At the time of publishing this article no standardised approach to the graphic representation of the presence of allergen ingredients in food products has been agreed. Various icons and visual representations are being used across the food industry. 

We believe that an industry wide icon set should be adopted. In a bid to drive standardisation we are offering the use of the Erudus Food Allergy Icons to the industry. Adoption of the icon set would enable a standardised approach for Food Manufacturers, Wholesalers, Food Service companies and Caterers alike, whilst building a consumer recognised mark to instil trust and confidence in the final product.
 

# Usage Guidlines:
You are free to use these icons and we would encourage you to adopt them as the industry standard solution. All we ask is the following guidelines are met:

– The icons must be presented in a legible fashion for the end user i.e they are easily readable and the end user can identify to which allergen ingredient the icon refers

– The icons should be displayed at a minimum of 50 pixels wide by 50 pixels high

– There should be a minimum of 10% whitespace between icons displayed together either horizontally or vertically or around an individual icon

– Icons should always be scaled proportionally

– We believe that the colour of the icon is an important visual cue for people, and that arbitrarily changing the colour could disrupt that cue and confuse users. No changes should be made to the icon itself or the colours, other than altering the size
